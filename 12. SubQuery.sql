select * from customer;
select * from ORDERS;


#1.
select cust_name,
(select max(order_amount) from orders) as amount
from customer;

#2. Subquery in 'Where' clause
select cust_name
from customer
where cust_id in
( select distinct cust_id 
  from orders
  where order_amount>=5000);


#3. Exists: returns TRUE if a subquery returns at least one row â€” otherwise, it returns FALSE.
select cust_name, city
from customer
where exists(
	select * from orders where order_id=102
);  -- returns whole table, bcz of TRUE

select cust_name, city
from customer
where exists(
	select * from orders where order_id=109
);  -- no records will be returned, bcz of FALSE

#4. instead of joins
select cust_name, city,
(select sum(order_amount)
 from orders o
 where o.cust_id=c.cust_id) as Total_orders
 from customer c;
 
-- using actual joins (similar to 4th section)
select c.cust_name,c.city,sum(order_amount) as total
from customer c
join orders o
on c.cust_id=o.cust_id
group by c.cust_id;  # groupping by cust_id, bcz it uniquely identifies each customer
 
#4.  Subquery in the FROM Clause

# Exp: The subquery (inside the parentheses) acts like a temporary table or derived table.
#	  The outer query is selecting from this temporary result set.
